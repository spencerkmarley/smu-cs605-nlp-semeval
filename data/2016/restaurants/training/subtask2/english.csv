1398844,60,,,1398844:1,"Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th."
1398844,60,,,1398844:2,"The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced."
1398844,60,,,1398844:3,Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
1398844,60,,,1398844:4,Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.
1398844,60,,,1398844:5,"For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc...."
1398844,60,,,1398844:6,Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.
1398844,60,,,1398844:7,"To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora."

1586174,84,,,1586174:2,not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly.
1586174,84,,,1586174:3,the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality.
1586174,84,,,1586174:4,"limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice."
1586174,84,,,1586174:5,"the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice, and the scallion on top of the fish."

740923,169,,,740923:3,Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.

TFS#10,212,,,TFS#10:2,The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings.

TFS#10,212,,,TFS#10:7,When we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost.

CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:1,I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:2,BUT not in a good way.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:3,I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:4,I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:5,We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:6,"Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience!"
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:7,And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:8,We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:9,Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:10,We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:11,The place is beautiful!
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:12,The hostess was very pleasant.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:13,"However, our $14 drinks were were horrible!"
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:14,"Once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed!"
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:15,"Since we were already waiting so long, we felt we had no other choice but to accept it."
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:16,Our experience did not ever get any better.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:17,For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:18,We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:19,After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:20,We asked for beverages and never received them.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:21,We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:22,My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:23,I would not expect this for a $55 dinner.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:24,By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:25,What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:26,The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:27,To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:28,"By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!"
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:29,If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible!
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:30,"I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money."
CLF#3,229,,,CLF#3:31,MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!

DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:0,Wretched and retching
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:1,This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life.
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:2,They have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant.
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:3,I have never been so disgusted by both food an service.
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:4,For starters they delivered us someone else's order.
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:5,"Fine, I wont hang you for that."
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:6,"However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin."
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:7,"Not one to jump to complaints (hence my lack of previous online reviewing), I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations."
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:8,"My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation."
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:9,None was made so i hung up.
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:10,Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:11,"My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant."
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:12,"Not only have I worked in restaurants for many years, I am now in culinary school, I am a huge lover of oysters and fish, and my girlfriend is half Korean!"
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:13,We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish.
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:14,"It wasn't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive."
DBG#2,231,,,DBG#2:15,Eat at your own risk.

Z#6,235,,,Z#6:0,Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City
Z#6,235,,,Z#6:1,"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!"
Z#6,235,,,Z#6:2,"Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city."
Z#6,235,,,Z#6:3,"If you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!)."
Z#6,235,,,Z#6:4,It’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!
Z#6,235,,,Z#6:5,"My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!"
Z#6,235,,,Z#6:6,I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it.
Z#6,235,,,Z#6:7,We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.
Z#6,235,,,Z#6:8,Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce.
Z#6,235,,,Z#6:9,"I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better."
Z#6,235,,,Z#6:10,The entrees were served with miso soup and rice.
Z#6,235,,,Z#6:11,The sake’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.
Z#6,235,,,Z#6:12,"For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal."
Z#6,235,,,Z#6:13,"Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie."
Z#6,235,,,Z#6:14,"I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner."

FF#4,240,,,FF#4:3,The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.
FF#4,240,,,FF#4:4,Polite acknowledgement is out;
FF#4,240,,,FF#4:5,supercilious scorn is in.
FF#4,240,,,FF#4:6,"And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?"

FF#3,298,,,FF#3:19,"This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it."
FF#3,298,,,FF#3:20,"Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!"

FF#3,298,,,FF#3:22,The level of rudeness was preposterous.

CLF#4,302,,,CLF#4:4,Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian.
CLF#4,302,,,CLF#4:5,The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
CLF#4,302,,,CLF#4:6,Well...they can run but they can't hide.
CLF#4,302,,,CLF#4:7,I live in the West Village and I've been to a lot of restaurants.

CLF#4,302,,,CLF#4:10,This place...god where do i begin.
CLF#4,302,,,CLF#4:11,It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.
CLF#4,302,,,CLF#4:12,The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!
CLF#4,302,,,CLF#4:13,"How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me."

BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:0,Don't go with a larger group than 4!
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:1,I went here for a family birthday dinner.
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:2,Five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a Thursday evening.
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:3,"The hostess said ""Wow that's a large group, unless you aren't together"", to which I replied ""no we are, and there will be one more, so a table for six please."""
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:4,"At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us."
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:5,The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions.
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:6,"There was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment."
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:7,"Not much of a selection of bottled beer either, we went with Brahma."
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:8,The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each).
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:9,"The lobster knuckles (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless."
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:10,"I believe there were 2 shrimp in the ""salt encrusted shrimp"" appetizer."
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:11,After we ate our appetizers (which took all of 8 minutes) we ordered another round of Brahma's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member.
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:12,The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order.
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:13,We replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay.
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:14,"She replied ""well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded."""
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:15,"We called the other person who was very close by, and she told us to order for her, so we did."
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:16,The food arrived in about 15 minutes.
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:17,I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass...which was very good.
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:18,"Everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice!"
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:19,I heard the lobster roll was excellent.
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:20,"They seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand)."
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:21,"All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh."
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:22,"Service not the friendliest to our ""large party""!"
BFC#9,324,,,BFC#9:23,Probably would not go back here.

1404042,325,,,1404042:1,Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.
1404042,325,,,1404042:2,Fish was overdone.
1404042,325,,,1404042:3,"Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again."
1404042,325,,,1404042:4,Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.
1404042,325,,,1404042:5,One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it.

1125006,326,,,1125006:3,My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it.

1126886,327,,,1126886:3,"You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare."

682250,328,,,682250:2,"Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best values for your money."

513395,329,,,513395:1,"Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience."
513395,329,,,513395:2,"Better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion."
513395,329,,,513395:3,Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.

1726427,330,,,1726427:2,"Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites, but everything was delicious."

BzG#4,331,,,BzG#4:1,"Small, bright, and clean, BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints, both in Astoria and out."
BzG#4,331,,,BzG#4:2,"What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected."
BzG#4,331,,,BzG#4:3,"All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted."

1662726,332,,,1662726:2,"When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently"
1662726,332,,,1662726:3,"While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude."
1662726,332,,,1662726:4,"The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint."

1084394,334,,,1084394:2,"The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced."
1084394,334,,,1084394:3,The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).
1084394,334,,,1084394:4,I will be going back and heartily recommend it!
