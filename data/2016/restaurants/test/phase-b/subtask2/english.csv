en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:1,,– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray's Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.
en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:2,,"Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service."
en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:3,,Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray's!
en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:4,,"To start things off, our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order."
en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:5,,"My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce."
en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:6,,"For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano."
en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:7,,The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).
en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:8,,My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans.
en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:9,,"I had a taste of all three items on her plate, and they were superb."
en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:10,,"Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that Ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?"
en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:11,,Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.
en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:12,,"Given that Ray's is a seafood restaurant...well, you get the idea..."
en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:13,,"All considered, I have to say that Ray's Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution."
en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:14,,"While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one."
en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918,90,,,en_Ray'sBoathouse_477775918:15,,"Oh yeah...the view was good, too."
