1,77,,,1:5,,The mouse is a little bit different than what you're used to though- it has one big flat panel and one full bar (instead of two separate ones) to click with- but you get used to it quite quickly.
1,77,,,1:6,,"AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer (when they have a certain promotion/offer going, of course)!"

B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK,157,,,B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK:4,,Now I have dual booted my laptop to Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 and it's not got too slow either.
B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK,157,,,B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK:5,,I am loving it completely.
B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK,157,,,B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK:6,,It does make a little noise but that's alright as it's not too much.
B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK,157,,,B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK:7,,It doesn't get heated up much even after continuous usage.
B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK,157,,,B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK:8,,"But the  touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever I am typing, my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it's really annoying."
B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK,157,,,B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK:9,,"I prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad, i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else."
B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK,157,,,B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK:10,,HP please fix it.
B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK,157,,,B00D7Z84OY_3_A3Q8WSIN4LWVLK:11,,A smaller touchpad would make life easier for Computer Science students or IT people much more easier.

394,158,,,394:1,,This laptop does everything I need it to very well.
394,158,,,394:2,,I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room;
394,158,,,394:3,,the two of us use it regularly.
394,158,,,394:4,,I wanted something that had a new Intel Core processors and HDMI port so that we could hook it up directly to our TV.
394,158,,,394:5,,The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features.
394,158,,,394:6,,The screen is bright and the keyboard is nice;
394,158,,,394:7,,I find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would.
394,158,,,394:8,,Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos.
394,158,,,394:9,,For those that care about noise this thing doesn't really make any;
394,158,,,394:10,,the i3 processor doesn't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on.
394,158,,,394:11,,I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.
394,158,,,394:12,,I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff.
394,158,,,394:13,,Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds.
394,158,,,394:14,,This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine;
394,158,,,394:15,,my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn't require a dedicated video card.
394,158,,,394:16,,Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase.
394,158,,,394:17,,I looked around and based off my price/features comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here.

42,161,,,42:1,,Bought with a credit card.
42,161,,,42:2,,Probbly the worst decision we ever made!
42,161,,,42:3,,It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard!
42,161,,,42:4,,the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one.
42,161,,,42:5,,the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon!
42,161,,,42:6,,pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were.
42,161,,,42:7,,i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.
42,161,,,42:8,,i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.
42,161,,,42:9,,also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.
42,161,,,42:10,,So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer

134,162,,,134:0,,I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty.
134,162,,,134:1,,The computer was shipped to their repair depot  on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned.
134,162,,,134:2,,I called their repair depot as was told they would send Me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot.
134,162,,,134:3,,They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place.
134,162,,,134:4,,The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.
134,162,,,134:5,,The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue.
134,162,,,134:6,,Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air? to Louisville Ky.
134,162,,,134:7,,By Air sounds more like by truck to Me.
134,162,,,134:8,,And Toshiba is totally unconcerned.
134,162,,,134:9,,The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter.
134,162,,,134:10,,We don't Mind and You don't Matter.
134,162,,,134:11,,I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter.
134,162,,,134:12,,When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you don't matter.

349,199,,,349:2,,This computer doesn't do that well with certain games it can't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.
349,199,,,349:3,,Oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.

130,201,,,130:1,,in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
130,201,,,130:2,,1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in.
130,201,,,130:3,,returned it.
130,201,,,130:4,,5 months dead again.
130,201,,,130:5,,They say sorry out of warranty.
130,201,,,130:6,,Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.
130,201,,,130:7,,Now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine.
130,201,,,130:8,,They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything.
130,201,,,130:9,,Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.
130,201,,,130:10,,So buyer beware when buying Toshiba

343,206,,,343:2,,"I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased."

374,274,,,374:1,,The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones.
374,274,,,374:2,,Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it.
374,274,,,374:3,,That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.
374,274,,,374:4,,It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.
374,274,,,374:5,,ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke.
374,274,,,374:6,,I babyed the heck out of it and i still do.
374,274,,,374:7,,To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.

374,274,,,374:9,,The internet speed is spectacular.
374,274,,,374:10,,The battery life is probably an hour at best.
374,274,,,374:11,,Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.
374,274,,,374:12,,I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.
374,274,,,374:13,,I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month.

B00KMRGF28_221_A4YVKTRE1Z1OU,294,,,B00KMRGF28_221_A4YVKTRE1Z1OU:1,,Bought it for my wife as a birthday present having owned a Dell in the past which was a great computer.
B00KMRGF28_221_A4YVKTRE1Z1OU,294,,,B00KMRGF28_221_A4YVKTRE1Z1OU:2,,This clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered.
B00KMRGF28_221_A4YVKTRE1Z1OU,294,,,B00KMRGF28_221_A4YVKTRE1Z1OU:3,,It would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for 5 minutes.
B00KMRGF28_221_A4YVKTRE1Z1OU,294,,,B00KMRGF28_221_A4YVKTRE1Z1OU:4,,I promptly sent it back for an exchange thinking this was just a bad one and surely the next one would be fine.

6,298,,,6:14,,It's a bummer and one out of five is being kind.

85,301,,,85:6,,It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow.

52,303,,,52:8,,"So you might ask, what did Apple do for me?"
52,303,,,52:9,,"For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this)."
52,303,,,52:10,,"Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby."

230,349,,,230:11,,I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT.
230,349,,,230:12,,I waited and waited and no laptop.

230,349,,,230:15,,I was psyched.

164,374,,,164:0,,I got the black MacBook two years ago and have never regretted it.
164,374,,,164:1,,It was a hard decision for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing.
164,374,,,164:2,,"But to be honest, I don't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming."
164,374,,,164:3,,So this was great for me.
164,374,,,164:4,,It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs.
164,374,,,164:5,,Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work.
164,374,,,164:6,,I also travel with it and it never gives me any problems.
164,374,,,164:7,,It was also cheaper than the Pro which made it even more appealing to me.
164,374,,,164:8,,"Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook, I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros."
164,374,,,164:9,,But I am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it.
164,374,,,164:10,,"I look forward to years of use, it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well."

189,375,,,189:16,,Another Great thing is the Beast graphics.
189,375,,,189:17,,They are so realistic I am just speechless.
189,375,,,189:18,,"I let my friend borrow it, and she knows nothing about computers, and she used it with ease."

11,379,,,11:2,,I have used different laptops in the past and I have to rate this one way above the rest.

11,379,,,11:4,,"The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick, but it is still a great notebook!"
11,379,,,11:5,,The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile.
11,379,,,11:6,,I love it!
11,379,,,11:7,,"I even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, iChat, Photobooth, garage band and more!"

235,380,,,235:1,,"I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop."
235,380,,,235:2,,Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.
235,380,,,235:3,,"So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message."
235,380,,,235:4,,"I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it, I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use."
235,380,,,235:5,,"Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook."

B00KMRGF28_193_A20GPA6RDO8DT7,383,,,B00KMRGF28_193_A20GPA6RDO8DT7:2,,The reviews at the time in late July 2014 were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost 4 star review...
B00KMRGF28_193_A20GPA6RDO8DT7,383,,,B00KMRGF28_193_A20GPA6RDO8DT7:3,,The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus.
B00KMRGF28_193_A20GPA6RDO8DT7,383,,,B00KMRGF28_193_A20GPA6RDO8DT7:4,,Now the graphics are not HD...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic (medium low grade) plastic.

391,384,,,391:1,,"Great OS, fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port."
391,384,,,391:2,,This is my second MacBook.
391,384,,,391:3,,"The first one I had was a 2006 model, not the Pro."
391,384,,,391:4,,I fell in love with it.
391,384,,,391:5,,This one has had the same effect.

391,384,,,391:8,,The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior.

391,384,,,391:10,,"It is everything I'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy."
391,384,,,391:11,,"For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy."
391,384,,,391:12,,It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.
391,384,,,391:13,,The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me (I prefer it dark) or if you can crank up the brightness.
391,384,,,391:14,,My real problem with it?
391,384,,,391:15,,The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie.
391,384,,,391:16,,I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.
391,384,,,391:17,,The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.
391,384,,,391:18,,Enabling the battery timer is useless.
391,384,,,391:19,,"The ""Time remaining"" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes."
391,384,,,391:20,,It's a joke.
391,384,,,391:21,,It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something.
391,384,,,391:22,,I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.
391,384,,,391:23,,This ain't it.
391,384,,,391:24,,My only other complaint is that it gets really hot.:-)
391,384,,,391:25,,"If you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied."

39,386,,,39:0,,I've had my Macbook Pro since August 2009.
39,386,,,39:1,,"Prior to this computer, I owned a PowerBook G4 for 6 years (quite a long time for a laptop)."
39,386,,,39:2,,That was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought.
39,386,,,39:3,,My MacBook Pro is no exception.
39,386,,,39:4,,On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I didn't like the trackpad.
39,386,,,39:5,,Since I've had this computer I've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.
39,386,,,39:6,,I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.
39,386,,,39:7,,"The display is incredibly bright, much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp."
39,386,,,39:8,,"The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well."
39,386,,,39:9,,"I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations (similar to Microsoft Office)."
39,386,,,39:10,,I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well.
39,386,,,39:11,,I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality!

B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO,387,,,B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO:0,,Great laptop from Apple!
B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO,387,,,B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO:1,,Apple is unrivaled in terms of build quality and functionality.
B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO,387,,,B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO:2,,The retina screen is absolutely beautiful and the touchpad is the best touchpad to date.
B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO,387,,,B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO:3,,The pair allow for seamless navigation throughout the whole interface.
B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO,387,,,B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO:4,,Battery life is astonishing given the processing power and high resolution display.
B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO,387,,,B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO:5,,I can easily get 10 hours out of a full charge.
B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO,387,,,B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO:6,,"Also, I find OS X much more simple and easy to use than Windows."
B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO,387,,,B0096VDM8G_34_A1B3PJ2QZABWXO:7,,"Overall, a high quality laptop and a great value considering all this computer has to offer."

306,388,,,306:0,,"I get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you're restricted to the width of your body for computing room."
306,388,,,306:1,,Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings).
306,388,,,306:2,,"I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home, and it runs just fine."
306,388,,,306:3,,"I play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive."
306,388,,,306:4,,"The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16"" laptop does."
306,388,,,306:5,,"I wouldn't play a first-person shooter with this, mind, but if you wanted to run MS Office, email, chat, download a video, listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store, and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in, I'd highly recommend checking this out."
306,388,,,306:6,,The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week.
306,388,,,306:7,,Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user's liking.

29,389,,,29:1,,This is the first macbook I have ever had.
29,389,,,29:2,,I came from the Dell Laptops and now I am so glad I switched when I needed a new laptop.
29,389,,,29:3,,The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance.
29,389,,,29:4,,"Although the price is higher then Dell laptops, the Macbooks are worth the dough."
29,389,,,29:5,,You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it.
29,389,,,29:6,,The macbook rarely requires a hard reboot.
29,389,,,29:7,,It just works flawlessly!
29,389,,,29:8,,Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action.
29,389,,,29:9,,"Dells are ok, HPs aren't that good, but Macs or Fantastic."
29,389,,,29:10,,"I honestly love my mac, thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict."
29,389,,,29:11,,If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications.

263,390,,,263:1,,The benefits were immediate!
263,390,,,263:2,,Awesome graphics!
263,390,,,263:3,,Applications respond immediately (not like the tired MS applications).
263,390,,,263:4,,"I can actually get work done with this MAC, and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop."
263,390,,,263:5,,The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great (I even put it to the test by accident)- excellent innovation!
263,390,,,263:6,,"The Apple applications (ex.iPhoto) are fun, easy, and really cool to use (unlike the competition)!"
263,390,,,263:7,,"After doing CAD work all day at work, using a higher end PC, I couldn't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer."
263,390,,,263:8,,This laptop rocks (only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple doesn't support)!
263,390,,,263:9,,"I've saved a lot of time and headaches so far, using my new MacBook Pro."
263,390,,,263:10,,"I am definitely sold, and not going back to PCs for home use!"

380,391,,,380:0,,I've had this laptop for about a month now.
380,391,,,380:1,,It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part.
380,391,,,380:2,,"The 2 GB of RAM is plenty, able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown."
380,391,,,380:3,,"The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft."
380,391,,,380:4,,My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.
380,391,,,380:5,,"This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range."
380,391,,,380:6,,"Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities."

196,392,,,196:1,,I have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it.
196,392,,,196:2,,"The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead."
196,392,,,196:3,,"If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now, maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer."
196,392,,,196:4,,I love this computer.
196,392,,,196:5,,"Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere, but still has a big enough screen to get everything done."
196,392,,,196:6,,"Everything is so easy to use, Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software."
196,392,,,196:7,,The only thing that I don't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to.
196,392,,,196:8,,Games being the main issue.
196,392,,,196:9,,It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can't play it because its not compatable with the software.
196,392,,,196:10,,I feel that enough people have Macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be.
196,392,,,196:11,,Other than that I don't have one complaint in the world!
